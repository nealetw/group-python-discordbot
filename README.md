# group-python-discordbot

This is a group project create by Casey Schablein, Robert Deal, and myself.
This discord bot written with the discord.py libraries has three key games / functions, each written by one of the group members.

The visual chess game can be credited to Casey Schablein, Connect 4 can be credited to Robert Deal, and the Dice Game can be credited to Tim Neale.
Each of these functions were written indvidually before combined all together into one single bot, and to be turned in as our python class final.
